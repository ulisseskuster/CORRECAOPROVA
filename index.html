            <h1>NASA</h1>
            <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States federal government responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. It was established in 1958 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and its headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. NASA's mission is to drive advances in science, technology, aeronautics, and space exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of Earth.

              NASA has been responsible for many significant achievements in space exploration, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Space Shuttle program, and the Hubble Space Telescope. It has also conducted numerous scientific research projects and missions, studying Earth and other planets, as well as the stars and galaxies beyond.
              
              NASA employs thousands of scientists, engineers, technicians, and support staff across its centers and facilities throughout the United States. The agency's budget is primarily funded by the federal government and is allocated for various programs, projects, and research initiatives.
              
              NASA's current priorities include the development of new spacecraft and technologies for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit, such as the Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. The agency also continues to conduct research on Earth's climate, atmosphere, and natural resources, as well as support international partnerships in space exploration.</p>
